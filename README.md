# Pathfinder-based typescript simple game project

**The Balls** (pol. kulki) is a classic online game from the early 2000s, where players navigate a ball through a series of turns.
Each turn new three balls appear in the board. The app uses a simple pathfinder module and is made fully for entertainment.
